# Abstract
this paper presents a deeper dive into the underlining mechanisms that could allow Uber to not cause traffic congestion. This study presents findings to specifically examine the following two questions: Does Uber surge pricing delay peak hour demands? Does Uber allow greater use of public transportation?  Despite of the ubiquitous presence of Uber, surprisingly, there is very limited information on this topic. This study will use trip data provided by Uber and TLC, time series technique and regression analysis to answer those questions.
